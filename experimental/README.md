# Experimental YANG Models

This subtree is intended for model authors who wish to publish experimental models that the community may review and use. There is no mandatory expectation that content in this area is part of an actual draft, but authors are encouraged to take this path in oirder to document the thinking behind a model, thereby providing full context for potential users or implementers.

It is recognized that there are other places model authors can also carry out similar work. For example, the IETF NETMOD Working Group maintains a [separate GitHub organization](https://github.com/netmod-wg) for such work that **is** bound to IETF drafts, so use of this area for experimental models is wholly at the discretion of model authors.

## Pruning

If content has not be refreshed for a considerable period of time, or if it is clear that the work has transitioned to an alternate location, then content may be pruned from the main branch to avoid confusion. Any content thus pruned will still be available in the repository history, and so no content will be lost.
