# Experimental YANG Models

This subtree is intended for model authors who wish to publish experimental models that the community may review and use. There is no mandatory expectation that content in this area is part of an actual draft, but authors are encouraged to take this path in order to document the thinking behind a model, thereby providing full context for potential users or implementers.

It is recognized that there are other places model authors can also carry out similar work. For example, the IETF NETMOD Working Group maintains a [separate GitHub organization](https://github.com/netmod-wg) for such work that **is** bound to IETF drafts, so use of this area for experimental models is wholly at the discretion of model authors.

## Pruning

Content may be pruned from the main branch to avoid confusion. This may happen for a couple of reasons:

- It is clear that the work has transitioned to an alternate location.
- Content has not been refreshed for a period of 6 months or more.

This pruning will occur at the discretion of the repository's committers and will remain subject to the normal review process for any pull request. Any content thus pruned will still be available in the repository history, ensuring no content is permanently lost.
