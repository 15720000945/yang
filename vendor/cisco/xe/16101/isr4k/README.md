## Model Variations

A small number of YANG models supported in IOS-XE 16.10.1 has a few differences between the platforms for which the deviation files have been created. If you are working with an impacted platform, you should copy the YANG models and the deviation files from the relevant platform subdirectory into your working directory and use that set of models and deviations instead. If you retrieve models directly from a device, you will get the correct set of models and deviations.
